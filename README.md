I chose SSX 3 because it was probably the game I spent the most time on as a child. It came out when I was 8 years old and I still play it semi-frequently now at age 26. It just doesn't get boring. It was a big reason I got into Snowboarding and is even partially responsible for my decision to move in 2019 to British Columbia where the game was made, as the game was based on the designers experiences in the ski-resorts of the area. Mainly Whistler-Blackcomb and Big White near Kelowna.

The creation process was interesting. This is the first time I have made a webpage from scratch and I am reasonably happy with how it turned out, this is the best I can do at my current skill level. It took me a long time, to the point of obsession, and I even found myself spending 3 hours on PhotoShop editing out the border of the individual snowflakes on the logo with a 1px size eraser. The difference was noticable to me but realistically I don't think anyone else would have noticed the difference. The page looks really good in both 4:3 and 16:9, but on mobile it looks broken. I think making it look good on mobile is beyond my skill level right now. It already passes the freecodecamp requirements and I think my time would be better spent now learning more topics. My creation process went in the following order:

* Decide topic
* Draw out possible concepts of the webpage
* Write text content draft
* Find visual assets online 
* Find a good photo of mine for the background
* Adjust aspect ratio and colour profile of background image to match closer to the logo, and remove unwanted skiers from the background
* Use an online AI image processor to increase the resolution of the downloaded assets 
* Start writing the HTML
* Try styling with CSS
* Relearn CSS because I couldn't figure out how to make what I wanted
* Troubleshoot visual bugs/misalignments (asked for help on Slack)
* Test out different effects, font sizes and padding
* Retouch visual assets on Photoshop 
* Finished
